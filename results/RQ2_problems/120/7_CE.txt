The bug in the original program is that it uses `long` type for input but the problem statement specifies that the input is positive integers which are not larger than 10^9. Therefore, `int` type should be used instead. The fixed program also adds additional conditions to handle the cases where both A and B are even, one of them is even, and neither of them is even. Additionally, the fixed program uses a variable `count` to keep track of the number of operations performed instead of calculating the result directly in the `while` loop.
